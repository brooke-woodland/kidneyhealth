## Product Description:

The KidneyHealth Web App is an app designed to combat the challenges faced by those suffering from Stage 3/4 kidney disease.

The app will tell them throughout the day whether they are within healthy limits or exceeding them.

## Technologies Used:

- [Python/Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation:

1. [Install Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2. Dependencies - install all dependencies outlined in the requirements.txt file using "pip" e.g. `pip install django`
3. Database - Create a new postgres database
4. Environment Variables - Create a file called ".env" in the project's root directory (it is already included in .gitignore). When hosting, these environment variables are implemented and encrypted on the host and not in the codebase as a .env file. The .env is used only in the development environment. Here is a list of the environment variables you need to include in the .env:

- FOOD_API_KEY = <the_food_api_key>
- DEBUG = <debug_option> "on" or "off"
- SECRET_KEY = <django_secret_key>
- FOOD_API_URL = <food_api_url>
- DB_PASSWORD = <postgres_database_password> For the database specifically
- DB_NAME = <postgres_database_name>

5. Migrations - In the terminal, run `python manage.py makemigrations`, then run `python manage.py migrate`
6. To start server, run `python manage.py runserver`
